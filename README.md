PostGuardian 

Description:
PostGuardian is an innovative web application designed to assess the vulnerability of social media users to potential social engineering attacks. By harnessing the power of machine learning, the application evaluates user posts, extracted from direct inputs, social media APIs, or images, to provide an in-depth vulnerability analysis.

Key Features:

1.	Multiple Post Input Methods: Users can easily input their social media posts in three ways:
•	Direct text input for quick and manual post evaluations.
•	Seamless integration with social media APIs, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., to fetch user posts directly.
•	Advanced OCR (Tesseract: open source/free) capabilities to extract text from images of posts, ensuring versatility in data input.

2.	In-depth Vulnerability Analysis: By using Openai API, PostGuardian processes the user posts to determine the susceptibility to social engineering threats.

3.	Comprehensive Reporting: PostGuardian offers a detailed report outlining the user's risk score, potential vulnerabilities, and tailored recommendations to strengthen their online safety.

4.	User-Friendly Interface: A streamlined UI ensures easy navigation and a smooth user experience, making the process of vulnerability assessment both efficient and effective.

5.	Robust Security Protocols: With user data security at its core, PostGuardian employs stringent measures such as OAuth2 and 2-Step Verification to safeguard sensitive user data, ensuring utmost privacy and trust.
